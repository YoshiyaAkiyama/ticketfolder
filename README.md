# ticketfolder
This repo is for raycast script used on Mac to generate
Generates ticket folder to manage cases.
Currently there are 2 scripts.
- mf
- tf

tf generates ticket folder using ticket id(numerical value that is 7 digit or more) within clipboard.
Once a folder is generated, tf will open that folder.

mf will move files from ~/Downloads directory to the generated ticket folder after tf is ran.
mf utilizes a file generated by tf that contains zendesk ticket id and tf command call time.
mf checks if the timestamp is within 4 hours so that mistakenly called mf doesnt move files.
File in downloads with timestamp newer than the tf call time is moved to the ticket folder.
